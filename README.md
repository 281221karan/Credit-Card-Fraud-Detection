# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a highly imbalanced binary classification problem. The goal of the project is to detect fraudulent transactions using classical machine learning models.

## 🧾 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Transactions: 284,807
- Fraud Cases: 492 (0.172%)

## ⚙️ Methods & Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Imbalanced data techniques (Under/Over/SMOTE)
3. Feature scaling & preprocessing
4. Model training:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
   - SVM
5. Threshold tuning for Recall/Precision trade-off

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
Fraud detection requires prioritizing:
- Recall (catch more frauds)

## 🧠 Key Insights
- The dataset is extremely imbalanced (0.172% positive samples).
- Logistic Regression is performing great.

## 🏁 Results
- Logistic Regression is getting 96+ recall Score

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas / NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
